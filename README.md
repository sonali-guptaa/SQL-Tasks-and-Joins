# SQL Tasks and Joins

This repository contains my hands-on SQL tasks completed during a Data Analytics internship. The tasks demonstrate table creation, data insertion, and the application of various SQL joins.

## Repository Structure
- **SQL_Scripts/**: Contains SQL scripts for creating tables, inserting data, and using different SQL joins.
- **Screenshots/**: Includes screenshots of outputs for each type of join.

## SQL Joins Covered
- **INNER JOIN**
- **LEFT JOIN**
- **RIGHT JOIN**
- **FULL OUTER JOIN** (simulated in MySQL using `UNION`)
- **CROSS JOIN**

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/SQL-Tasks-and-Joins.git`
2. Execute the scripts in `SQL_Scripts` to recreate the tables and perform the joins.
3. Check out the `Screenshots` folder for the visual outputs.

## Highlights
- Gained practical experience with SQL join types.
- Learned to structure and manipulate relational databases efficiently.
